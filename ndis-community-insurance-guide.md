# NDIS & Community Sector Insurance Guide Australia (2026)

**By Ash Walker — Insurance Broker, Adelaide**

Insurance for NDIS providers, community organisations, and not-for-profits can feel particularly complex. The sector has unique risks, regulatory considerations, and service delivery models that standard business insurance doesn’t always address properly.

This guide explains the key areas organisations should understand when reviewing their insurance.

---

## Why Insurance is Different in This Sector

Organisations working with vulnerable people carry additional responsibilities and exposures, including:

- Participant safety risks  
- Professional duty of care  
- Staff and volunteer exposures  
- Regulatory scrutiny  
- Complex service environments  

Insurance needs to reflect these realities.

---

## Common Insurance Types for NDIS & Community Organisations

### Public Liability Insurance
Protection against third-party injury or property damage arising from service delivery.

### Professional Indemnity Insurance
Important where services involve care, advice, or decision-making affecting participants.

### Management Liability Insurance
Protects board members and leadership against governance, employment, and compliance risks.

### Personal Accident / Volunteer Cover
Relevant where volunteers or non-employees are involved in operations.

### Property Insurance
Covers buildings, equipment, and contents where applicable.

### Cyber Insurance
Increasingly relevant due to sensitive participant data.

## Sector-Specific Considerations

Insurance should consider:

- Participant transport  
- In-home support services  
- Behavioural support activities  
- Medication assistance  
- Support worker activities  
- Contractors vs employees  
- Multiple service environments  

Policies must align with actual operations.

---

## Common Mistakes Organisations Make

Some frequent issues include:

- Assuming NDIS registration automatically defines insurance needs  
- Policies not reflecting real service activities  
- Underestimating professional liability exposure  
- Choosing insurers unfamiliar with the sector  
- Focusing only on premium cost  

Insurance decisions should be made with a long-term view.

---

## When to Review Insurance

Insurance should be reviewed when:

- Services expand or change  
- Participant complexity increases  
- Workforce structure changes  
- New funding contracts begin  
- Incidents occur  
- Regulatory expectations evolve  

The sector changes quickly — insurance should keep pace.

## Working With a Specialist Broker

Organisations often benefit from working with someone who understands:

- Sector risks  
- Regulatory environment  
- Operational realities  
- Insurance market appetite  

The goal is confidence that coverage will respond when needed.
