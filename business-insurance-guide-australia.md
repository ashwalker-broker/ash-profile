# Business Insurance Guide Australia (2026)

**By Ash Walker — Insurance Broker, Adelaide**

Insurance can feel confusing for business owners. Policies are full of technical language, and it’s often unclear what you actually need versus what you’re being sold.

This guide explains the core types of business insurance in Australia, common mistakes, and how to approach insurance in a way that supports your business properly.

## Why Business Insurance Matters

Insurance is ultimately about protecting:

- Your balance sheet  
- Your reputation  
- Your ability to continue operating after a loss  

The right structure provides confidence. The wrong structure can create major problems at claim time.

## Core Types of Business Insurance

Most businesses consider a combination of:

### Public Liability Insurance
Protects against third-party injury or property damage claims arising from your operations.

### Professional Indemnity Insurance
Relevant if you provide advice, services, or expertise. Covers financial loss claims from alleged errors or omissions.

### Management Liability Insurance
Protects directors and managers personally against claims relating to governance, employment practices, and regulatory issues.

### Property / ISR Insurance
Covers buildings, contents, stock, and business interruption following insured damage events.

### Cyber Insurance
Increasingly important as businesses rely on technology and data.

## Common Mistakes Businesses Make

Some of the most common issues I see include:

- Choosing cover purely on price  
- Copying another business’s insurance structure  
- Underinsuring assets or revenue  
- Not understanding exclusions  
- Policies not aligned with contracts or obligations  
- Assuming “it will be covered” without checking  

Insurance should reflect how your business actually operates.

## When to Review Insurance

You should review insurance when:

- Revenue changes significantly  
- You hire staff  
- Services expand  
- New contracts are signed  
- Locations change  
- Regulations shift  

Insurance should evolve with your business.

## How to Choose the Right Insurance Broker

A good broker should:

- Explain things clearly without jargon  
- Understand your industry  
- Ask detailed questions about operations  
- Focus on long-term protection, not just premiums  
- Be accessible when you need advice  

Insurance works best when it’s a partnership, not a transaction.

---

## Working With an Insurance Broker

My approach is simple:

- Understand your business first  
- Identify real risks  
- Design appropriate coverage  
- Support you throughout the year  

Insurance should feel clear and supportive — not stressful.
