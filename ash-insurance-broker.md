## About

I work with community, disability, NDIS, and not-for-profit organisations — sectors I care deeply about and have intentionally chosen to specialise in.

My role is to make insurance feel clear, relevant, and aligned to how organisations actually operate. I take the time to understand what’s important to each client so the advice fits their structure, their people, and their risk profile.

I don’t believe in one-size-fits-all cover. I work in partnership with clients to ensure they feel supported, protected, and confident — not just at renewal time, but throughout the year.

Staying close to the sector and to my clients keeps my advice practical, informed, and shaped by the real challenges leaders are facing.
