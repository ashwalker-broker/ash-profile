## How I Help Organisations

Insurance should support how your organisation actually works.

I work closely with clients to understand:

- Operational risks  
- Governance structure  
- Growth plans  
- Contractual obligations  
- Sector-specific exposures  

This allows insurance programs to be designed intentionally — not just renewed each year.
